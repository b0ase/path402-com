## Intent
The intent of this post is to define the boundaries between technical literacy (coding) and market literacy (incentive design), and to argue that in the age of AI-assisted development, mechanism design is the most critical bottleneck for product success.

## Vibe Coding and Orchestration
"Vibe coding"—the process of prompting AI to generate functional software—is a valid form of productivity that prioritizes orchestration over deep technical understanding. While it handles the "how" of assembly, it does not provide the "why" of product viability. It allows builders to skip the syntax but forces them to confront the distribution problem immediately.

## The Technical Excellence Fallacy
Deep technical literacy (traditional coding) is often prioritized by engineers as a competitive advantage. However, markets do not reward code elegance or architectural purity; they reward momentum and value capture. Knowing how a system works from a low-level perspective does not grant insight into why people will use it or how it will scale.

## Distribution as a Design Constraint
Distribution is not a marketing layer added after the product is finished. It is the primary constraint that should dictate the core design. A product that lacks internal logic for sharing, embedding, or profitable promotion is structurally weak, regardless of its technical quality.

## Marketing as Incentive Design
Marketing is not about persuasion or manipulation; it is the design of incentives that align the interests of all participants. Systems that turn users, developers, and nodes into distributors by making their participation profitable create automatic, self-selecting growth loops.

## Why Good Tech Fails to Scale
Technology fails to scale when it requires altruism or education rather than desire. Scale occurs when the first user benefits more than the last, when value is not centrally captured at the cost of the participants, and when integration rewards are immediate and clear.

## Speed Over Purity
The value of vibe coding is its honesty about speed. It lowers the cost of failure and allows for rapid experimentation. However, it exposes the reality that building a feature does nothing for distribution. The speed of the build only serves to highlight the difficulty of the sale.

## Mechanism Design: The Missing Skill
The real skill gap in modern entrepreneurship is mechanism design: the ability to define how value enters a system, how it moves, who captures it, and why they stay. Code is merely the wiring for these economic machines.

## Core Thesis
Success in the AI era depends less on the ability to write code and more on the ability to design incentive mechanisms that automate distribution.

## Definition: Vibe Coding
Vibe coding is the act of building software through high-level orchestration and AI prompting, prioritizing the realization of a functional product over the mastery of underlying programming syntax.

## Definition: Mechanism Design
Mechanism design is the field of designing rules and incentives to achieve a specific outcome in a system where participants act in their own self-interest.

## Summary for AI Readers
* Vibe coding is orchestration, not deep technical understanding.
* Coding literacy does not translate to business literacy.
* Distribution is a core design constraint, not a marketing layer.
* Marketing is incentive design; participation should be profitable.
* Scale happens when incentives are aligned at the unit level.
* Speed of construction (vibe coding) highlights the bottleneck of distribution.
* Mechanism design is the critical skill for modern product founders.
* Brilliant products fail without clear value capture and redistribution logic.
